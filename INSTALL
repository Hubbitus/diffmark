diffmark depends on libxml2 for parsing XML - you must have libxml2
installed before building diffmark. libxml2 is available from
http://xmlsoft.org/ .

Otherwise, installation follows the GNU standard: just run (in this
directory)
	./configure
	make

then, to test the build result (optional, requires expect)
	make check

and then, as root
	make install
