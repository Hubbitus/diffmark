diffmark depends on libxml2 for parsing XML - you must have libxml2
installed before building diffmark. libxml2 is available from
http://xmlsoft.org/ .

If you're using the git repo, you also need autotools to generate the
makefiles (users of the packaged diffmark may skip this step - it's
done during packaging):

autoheader
aclocal
libtoolize
automake --add-missing
autoconf

Otherwise, installation follows the GNU standard: just run (in this
directory)
	./configure
	make

then, to test the build result (optional, requires expect)
	make check

and then, as root
	make install
